EMIL Project: HUME 1.0 - Java Implementation

HUME 1.0 is a toy simulation to simulate the genesis of 
social order following the narrative of the Scottish
18th century Philosopher David Hume.

It was developed as one component of the
"Emergence in the loop"-Research-Project at the university
of Bayreuth in 2008.

This directory contains the Java implementation of HUME 1.0.
In order to run the program, open a shell, change to the
deployment directory and enter the command:

javaws HUME.jnlp

For a detailed documentation of the program see:

Documents/HUME_java_implementation.pdf

as well as the javadoc files under the "doc" directory.
